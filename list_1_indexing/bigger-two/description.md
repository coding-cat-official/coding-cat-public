Start with two integer lists `a` and `b`, each of length 2. Consider the sum of the values in each list. Return the list which has the larger sum. In the event of a tie, return `a`.

For example:
- `biggerTwo([1, 2], [3, 4]) → [3, 4]`
- `biggerTwo([3, 4], [1, 2]) → [3, 4]`
- `biggerTwo([1, 1], [1, 2]) → [1, 2]`
