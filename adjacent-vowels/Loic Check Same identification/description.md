Given two arrays, and a target, Return True if the target can be found in both lists(arrays) at the same position. Otherwise, False.

Examples:
check_id( l1, l2, target ) → bool

check_id([2, 3, 10], [3, 10, 2], 2) → False  
check_id([2, 3, 10], [2, 10, 3], 3) → False
check_id([2, 3, 10], [2, 10, 3], 2) → True  # 2 is at index 0 in both list : they have the same id.
