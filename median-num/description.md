Given a list of positive integers that are sorted from small to big whose length can be even or odd, determine the median of the list. The median is the “middle number ” of a list if the length of the list is odd. The median is the “two middle numbers ” / 2 if the length of the list is even.


For example:
-median_num([1,3,3,6,7,8,9]) -> 6
-median_num([1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9]) -> (4 + 5) / 2 -> 4.5
