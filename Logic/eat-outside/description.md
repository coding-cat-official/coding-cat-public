Dawson is lucky in that we have a lot of greenspace in downtown Montreal. However, just because we have a nice campus doesn't mean it's always the best to go outside. 

Write a function that determines is it's a good idea to eat outside. Return `true` if it is summer and not raining, otherwise return `false`.
