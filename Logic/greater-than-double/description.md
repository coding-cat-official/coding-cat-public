Write a function `greater_than_double(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return `True` if one of the numbers is greater than double the other number. 

For example: 
- `greater_than_double(5, 12) → True` because `12` is greater than double `5`. 
- `greater_than_double(8, 15) → False` because neither `8` is greater than double `15` nor `15` is greater than double `8`.
