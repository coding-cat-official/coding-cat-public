Write a function `float_in_between(x: float, y: float, z: float) -> bool` that returns `True` if `x` is strictly between `y` and `z` (i.e., greater than the smaller of the two and less than the larger), and `False` otherwise. 

For example:
- `float_in_between(5.0, 3.0, 8.0) → True` → `5.0` is between `3.0` and `8.0`.
