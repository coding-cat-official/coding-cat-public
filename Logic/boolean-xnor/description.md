Write a function `boolean_xnor(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool` that takes two boolean inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return the result of the exclusive NOR (XNOR) operation on these inputs. In other words, the function should return `True` if both inputs are the same (both `True` or both `False`), and `False` otherwise. 

For example, if the inputs are `True` and `False`, the output should be `False` because the inputs are different.
