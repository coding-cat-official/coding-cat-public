Write a function `boolean_xor(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool` that takes two boolean inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return the result of the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on these inputs. In other words, the function should return `True` if exactly one of the inputs is `True` (but not both) and `False` otherwise. 

For example, if the inputs are `True` and `False`, the output should be `True` because only one of the inputs is `True`.
