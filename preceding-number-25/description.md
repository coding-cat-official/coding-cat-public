Given a list of integers of length 5, for every `2` in the list, add the number `5` in front of it, and for every `5` in the list, add the number `2` in front of it. If there are no `2`s or `5`s, return the original list.


For example:
- `preceding_number25([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) → [1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]`
- `preceding_number25([2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) → [5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2]`
- `preceding_number25([4, 8, 15, 16, 23]) → [4, 8, 15, 16, 23]`
