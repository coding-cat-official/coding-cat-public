Write a function `add_evens(numbers: list) -> list` that takes a list `numbers` as an input and returns the same list with an extra element. This extra element should be the sum of all the even numbers in the list. For example, if the input is `[1,2,3,4]`, the output should be `[1,2,3,4,6]` since `2 and 4` are even and their sum is 6. Hint: Every input will include at least 1 even number.
