Write a function `makes_ten(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return `True` if either of the integers is `10`, or if their sum is `10`. 

For example: 
- `makes_ten(7, 3) → True` because their sum is `10`
- `makes_ten(10, 5) → True` because one of the integers is `10` 
- `makes_ten(2, 3) → False`
