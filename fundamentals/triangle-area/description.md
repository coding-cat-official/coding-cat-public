Write a function `triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float` that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: 

**Area = 1/2 x base x height.**

For example:
- `triangle_area(10.0, 5.0) â†’ 25.0` because the area of the triangle is `0.5 * 10 * 5`.
