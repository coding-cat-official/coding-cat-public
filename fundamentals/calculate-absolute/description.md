Write a function `calculate_absolute(n: int) -> int` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its absolute value. The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value, so if the input is `-5`, the output should be `5`, and if the input is `7`, the output should be `7`. 


**Hint**: you may want to Google how to find the absolute value of an integer in Python!
