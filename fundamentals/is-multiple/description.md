Write a function `is_multiple(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integers, `a` and `b`. The function should return `True` if `a` is a multiple of `b` (i.e., `a` divided by `b` has no remainder), and `False` otherwise. 

For example: 
- `is_multiple(10, 2) â†’ True` because `10` is divisible by `2`
