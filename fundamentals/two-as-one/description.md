Write a function `two_as_one(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool` that takes three integer inputs, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function should return `True` if it is possible to add any two of the integers to get the third integer. Specifically, return `True` if any of the following conditions are met:

- `a + b == c`
- `a + c == b`
- `b + c == a`

If none of these conditions are met, return `False`. For example, if the inputs are `2`, `3`, and `5`, the output should be `True` because `2 + 3 == 5`. If the inputs are `1`, `2`, and `4`, the output should be `False` because no two of the integers add up to the third.
