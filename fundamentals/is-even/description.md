Write a function `is_even(n: int) -> bool` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if the integer is even, and `False` otherwise. 

For example:
- `is_even(4)` -> `True` (because `4` is an even number)


**Hint:** This problem is all about finding the remainder of a division. Google how to do this in Python.
