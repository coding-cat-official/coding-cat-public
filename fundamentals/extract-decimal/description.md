Write a function `extract_decimal(f: float) -> float` that takes a floating-point number `f` as input and returns only the decimal part of `f` as a floating-point number. 

For example:
- `extract_decimal(12.345) â†’ 0.345`

Depending on how you solve this, you may have to deal with quirks in floating point operations in
Python. To learn more about this quirk and workarounds, see [this blog post](https://medium.com/@akhilnathe/understanding-the-quirks-of-floating-point-arithmetic-in-python-7d7d436c8338).
