Write a function `sum_of_odd(lst)` that returns the sum off all odd numbers in a list besides the first and last numbers. If the first or last number appears in the list elsewhere, don't include it in the sum. Assume there are no negative integers in the list.

For example:
- If the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, you should answer, so the output is `3`.
- If the list is `[1, 9, 1, 4, 3, 2, 7, 7]`, you should answer, so the output is `12`.
- If the list is `[2, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]`, you should answer, so the output is `10`.
