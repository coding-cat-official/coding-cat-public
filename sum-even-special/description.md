Given a list of integers, find the sum of all even integers that are
either prime or divisible by 3. Return the sum. If there are no such numbers, return 0.
An even number is considered prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples:

- `sumOfEvenSpecial([2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13])` → `8` (2 is even and prime, 6 is even
and divisible by 3)
- `sumOfEvenSpecial([10, 14, 15, 22, 2, 12])` → `14` (2 and 12 are even and spe-
cial)
- `sumOfEvenSpecial([4, 6, 8, 12])` → `18` (6 and 12 are even and divisible by 3)
