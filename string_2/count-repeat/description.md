Given 2 strings `a` and `b`, return the total amount of sequences where `b` is repeated in a row. Note: the string `a` can be of any length and `b` will always be one character.

For example:
- `count_repetition("byzzx", "z") → 1`
- `count_repetition("bxzxc", "x") → 0`
- `count_repetition("xxxcbxxcx", "x") → 2`
