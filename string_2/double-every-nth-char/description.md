Given a string and a positive integer n, return a modified string where every character at position n and its multiples is doubled. Count positions starting from 1.

For example:
double_nth(“hello", 2) → 'heelllo' (doubles chars at positions 2,4)
double_nth('python', 3) → 'pytthonn' (doubles char at position 3,6)
double_nth('code', 1) → 'ccooddee' (doubles every char)
