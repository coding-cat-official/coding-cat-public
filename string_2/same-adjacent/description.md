Write a function `same_adjacent(str, char)` that takes in a string and a single character. Return the number of times that the single character appears in the string, but only if it appears next to itself.

For example: 
- `same_adjacent("hello", "l")` → `2`
- `same_adjacent("test", "t")` → `0`
- `same_adjacent("aabbaa", "a")` → `4`
