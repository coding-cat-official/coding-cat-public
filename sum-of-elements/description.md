Given a list of integers, find and return the sum of all elements in the list except for any duplicates. For the purpose of this problem, a duplicate is any integer that appears more than once in the list, and it should not be counted in the sum.

Example:

    1.unique_sum([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]) → 8 (since only 1, 3, and 4 are unique)
    2.unique_sum([5, 5, 6, 6, 7]) → 7 (since only 7 is unique)
    3.unique_sum([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) → 150 (since all numbers are unique)
