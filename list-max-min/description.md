Given a list, write a function `list_max_min(nums)` that returns another list that contains repeated results of the additions of the smallest value to the biggest value. The elements of the new list need to sum up a close to 30 as possible without exceeding 30. Assume the list will be of length 2 or more.

- Make sure to deal with the correct sum of the new list
- <em> Note: </em> If the sum of the minimum and maximum value of a list is less or equal to 0, the function should return 0.

For example:

- If `num` is `[3, 4, 6, 5]`, the output is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- If `num` is `[2, 5, 4, 3]`, the output is `[7, 7, 7, 7]`
- If `num` is `[0, 0, 0]`, the output is `0`
