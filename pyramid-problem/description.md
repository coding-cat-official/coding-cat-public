Write a function `pyramid_volume(L, W, H)` that determines the volume of a pyramid with a rectangular base:

- If the volume of the pyramid is greater than 40, return: "That's a big pyramid!"
- If the volume of the pyramid is between 25-39, return: "I mean, it's alright..."
- If the volume of the pyramid is below 25, return: "Baby pyramid"

For example, 
- pyramid_volume(5, 6, 7) --> "That's a big pyramid!"
- pyramid_volume(3, 6, 6) --> "I mean, it's alright..."
- pyramid_volume(2, 3, 4) --> "Baby pyramid"


Note: Rectangular base pyramid volume formula = (length x width x height)/3)
