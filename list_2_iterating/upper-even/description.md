Given a string, return a new string where each character with an even index is uppercase, and each character with an odd index is lowercase. 
 
For example:
- `upper_even_i("hello")` → `"HeLlO"`  
- `upper_even_i("Darling")` → `"DaRlInG"`  
- `upper_even_i("computer")` → `"CoMpUtEr"`  

**Hint:** The use of `.upper()` and `.lower()` functions might be needed.
