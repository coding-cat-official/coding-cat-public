Given a list of integers, find and return the sum of all elements in the list except for any duplicates. For the purpose of this problem, a duplicate is any integer that appears more than once in the list, and it should not be counted in the sum.

For example:
- `unique_sum([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])` → `8`  
- `unique_sum([5, 5, 6, 6, 7])` → `7`  
- `unique_sum([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])` → `150`
