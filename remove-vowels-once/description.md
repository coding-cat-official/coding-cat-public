Write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the      vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y)
removed. Only remove the vowels, the first time they are printed in the word.

For example:
- remove-vowels-once(“train”) → “trn” (“a” and “i” were removed)
- remove-vowels-once(“dairy”) → “dr” (“a”, “i" and "y" were removed)
- remove-vowels-once(“debate”) → “dbte” (the first “e” and “a” were removed
