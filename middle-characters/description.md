Given a string, return the number of times the first character is repeated excluding at the first and lastindex. Keep in mind that upper-case and lower-case letters are counted as the same.

For example:

- middle_characters(“abanAnab”) → 3

- middle_characters(“Boebob”) → 1

- middle_characters(“essechangaTacosavadoelpase”) → 2
