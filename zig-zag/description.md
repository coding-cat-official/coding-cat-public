Given a string, make a new one following a zig-zag pattern. This means it will take the first letter, the last, the second, second to last, until there aren’t any letters left in the original string.

For example:
- zig_zag(“apple”) → ‘aeplp’
- zig_zag(“string”) → ‘sgtnri’
- zig_zag(“codingbat”) → ‘ctoadbign’
