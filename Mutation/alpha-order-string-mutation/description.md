Given one word containing a string of letters, return a string of the letters in alphabetical order. 
Letters may be repeated and are not capitalized. 


***WARNING:*** using the sort() function will lead to imminent death.

**Note:** This is a hard problem that involves nested loops. Proceed with caution

For example:
- `alpha_order(“amongus”)` → “agmnosu”
- `alpha_order(“patrfmsf”)` → affmprst”
- `alpha_order(“almost”)` → “almost”

**Hint:** turn the string into a list before organizing it, and "a"<"b" = True.
